Systematic Long Range Phasing

This is a Bayesian network based Long Range Phasing
implementation. Long range phasing was first described by Kong
et.al. 2008 (Nature Genetics) and this is a novel probabilistic
formulation by Kimmo Palin and Richard Durbin (of the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute)

The SLRP phasing model and this implementation was described in
